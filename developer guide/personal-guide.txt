1) On Windows: Double-click setup.bat
2) On Linux/Mac: Run ./setup.sh
3) From npm: Run npm run setup
4) Or if they upload the project to a server without installation, they'll see the visual setup guide with detailed instructions for different deployment scenarios.
The setup guide and scripts cover everything needed for local development, custom server deployment, and cloud platforms (Netlify and Vercel).

Deployment Instructions Clarification

*****************************************


The deployment process for your Advanced File Converter application:

Netlify Deployment

                                (Vercel automatically provides this URL once your deployment is complete, and you can find it in the Vercel dashboard.)
Custom Server Deployment
        1. Ensure Node.js v18+ is installed on your server
        2. Upload the project files via SFTP/SSH or git clone
        3. Install dependencies: npm run install-all
        4. Build the client: npm run build
        5. Set environment variables:
                ```terminal : //run this command 

                    export NODE_ENV=production
                    export PORT=80  # or your preferred port
                    REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
                ```
        6. start the server
                ```
                    npm start
                ```
        7. For persistent operation , use PM2 
                ```
                    npm install -g PM2
                    pm2 start npm -- start
               ```


The project includes all necessary configuration files for these deployment methods. The deploy-check script can verify that everything is set up correctly before deployment.


#info what dose it mean by  Setting Environment Variables

URLs, etc.).

                    • Any other variables from . env. exæple
    
    To set environment variables: On Vercel:
            1. Go to your project settings in Vercel dashboard
