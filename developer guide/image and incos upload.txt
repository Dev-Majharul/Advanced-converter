I. Created three key directories for static assets:
• client/public/images - For general images accessible via the public URL
• client,'public/icons - For favicons and app icons
• client/src/assets - For images that need to be imported directly in React components
2. Updated client/publåc/index. html to reference favicons from the new icons directory.
3. Created a manifest.json file with references to the icon paths for PWA support
4. Added a route in server/index.js to serve uploaded images:


For favicon and app icons:
1. Place your favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, log0192.png and log0512.png in the client/public/icons folder.
2. They'll be automatically referenced by the updated index.html and manifest.json files.
For site images:
I. Put images used in your React app in client/src/assets folder
2. Import them in your components like:

For user uploaded images:
I. These will automatically be saved to the server's uploads directory when users upload them
2. They can be accessed at path
3. The server-side route I added makes them publicly accessible
If you need a logo in the Ul right away, create it and place it in the appropriate directory based on where you'll use it. For example, if it's part of the site
header, put it in client/src/assets and import it into your header component.
